Hookshot is a static recompilation. The game's code is translated to C and compiled into a Windows program, the
console's system software is reimplemented, and the Switch 2 graphics are rebuilt on Vulkan. All of this happens
**on your PC, from your own copy of the game**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository **does not contain the game, keys or an executable**, and it does not explain how to get them. You
> need your own copy. Everything the build creates (`hookshot.exe`, the generated code, the shader caches and your
> saves) comes from your game and stays on your PC. Never share those files.

## Project status

Experimental. It has only been tested on **one PC** (Ryzen 5 7600X, RTX 4060 Ti 16 GB), mostly in the area at the start
of the game.

| What | Status |
|---|---|
| Kokiri Forest: reaching gameplay and walking around | ✅ Works |
| Sound, controller, keyboard and saves | ✅ Works |
| In-game menu, frame generation and upscaling | ✅ Works |
| Black flashes while moving | ✅ Fixed in testing, more play needed |
| Performance without frame generation | ⚠️ About 50 fps walking, not yet a steady 60 |
| Models with missing pieces (doors, fences, parts of trees) | ✅ Fixed where tested, more play needed |
| Stutter when entering new areas | ⚠️ Still happens, mostly the first time |
| Ultrawide | ⚠️ The 3D keeps its shape, but the HUD is stretched and the picture is softer |
| Hyrule Field and the rest of the game | ❓ Not tested yet |
| AMD and Intel cards | ❓ Never tested |

## How to build

The game does not come ready-made: it is built on your PC from your copy.

**With Hookshot Builder, the easiest:**

1. Download the HookshotBuilder zip from the Releases page, extract it, and run `HookshotBuilder.exe`. Keep the `tools`
   folder beside it.
2. Choose your game's `.nup`, or your `romfs` and `exefs` folders. The builder checks that it is the right version.
3. Choose a language and a folder for the finished game, and start the build.
4. When it finishes, open `hookshot.exe` in that folder.

**From the command line:**

```powershell
python -I nx2/make_game.py --nup "C:\path\your-game.nup" --out "C:\Games\Hookshot" --language en-US
```

Or with folders:

```powershell
python -I nx2/make_game.py --romfs "C:\path\romfs" --exefs "C:\path\exefs" --out "C:\Games\Hookshot" --language en-US
```

Add `--check` with your `.nup` or `--exefs` to only check the game's version. It builds nothing.

A build takes about 40 minutes, and you can use your PC in the meantime.

### What you need

- The Visual Studio C++ tools and the Windows SDK. Microsoft does not allow these to be bundled, so install
  [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with "Desktop development with C++". The
  builder tells you if they are missing.
- 64-bit Windows 10 or 11.
- A graphics card with Vulkan 1.3 and mesh shaders, with an up-to-date driver. Only NVIDIA has been tested.
- 16 GB of RAM or more. A run uses about 10 GB.
- About 60 GB free while building.
- **Your copy of the game at the supported version:** program `0400486024DEC000`, update v131072, build `e0f3ccfa`.
  Other versions do not work.

To build from the command line you also need:

- Python 3 with `lz4`, `numpy`, `capstone` and `unicorn`.
- The clang from [emsdk](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk), at `C:\emsdk`.
- Visual Studio 2022 with .NET 8, only if you want to change the builder itself.
- The prebuilt tools that go in `third_party/`: `a64emit`, `lld-link`, `zbic` and SDL2.

### What this does on your PC

- The build reads your game and never changes it. It writes to the folder you choose and to
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HookshotBuilder`.
- The romfs is hard-linked instead of copied where the disk allows it.
- To uninstall, delete the game folder and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HookshotBuilder`.

### If something goes wrong

| Problem | What to do |
|---|---|
| "Hookshot supports build e0f3ccfa" | Check that you chose the right game with its update installed |
| The game opens and closes | Update your graphics driver |
| Stutter the first time you see something | Normal for now: shaders are being prepared. It gets better when you pass through the same place again |
| The game is in the wrong language | Change the code in `language.txt` beside the game. The file lists them all |

If the problem continues, report it with where you were in the game, your graphics card and a screenshot or video.
Never send game files.

## In-game menu

Press <kbd>Insert</kbd> in game, or <kbd>&#96;</kbd> on a keyboard without Insert (Apple's, for one). Everything is
off by default, and your choices are saved in `hookshot_options.ini` beside the game.

| Option | Choices |
|---|---|
| Frame generation | Off, 2x, 3x, 4x |
| Frame pacing | Off, On |
| Resolution | Auto (the game's own dynamic resolution), 100%, 75%, 67%, 50% |
| Upscaling | Off, Catmull-Rom, Lanczos |
| Sharpness | 0 to 100% |
| Game speed | Per frame, Real time |
| Handheld profile | Off, On |
| Ultrawide | 16:9, Monitor's shape |
| Fullscreen | Off, On (<kbd>F11</kbd> also switches it) |
| FPS counter | Off, On |
| Volume | 0 to 100% |

With Game speed on Per frame, the game runs slower whenever it is below 60 fps. Real time keeps it at normal speed.

### Controls

Use a controller, or the keyboard and mouse. On the keyboard, <kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> move
and the arrow keys turn the camera.

## How it works

1. `nx2/lift.py` translates the game's ARM64 code to C.
2. `nx2/build.py` compiles that C together with `host/`, which plays the part of the console's system.
3. `host/nvn_native.c` records the game's NVN2 graphics calls, and `gpu/vk/` replays them on Vulkan.
4. Switch 2 Ampere shaders are lowered to Maxwell (`lower_to_maxwell.h`) and translated to SPIR-V by Eden's shader
   recompiler.

More detail is in the [development guide](docs/development.md) and the [design notes](docs/design.md).

## Want to help?

Testing on other graphics cards and reporting the result already helps a lot, and so does playing further into the
game than anyone has yet.

Bigger ways to help:

- **Linux support.** Hookshot only runs on Windows today. The Vulkan renderer is a good start, but the system layer
  still needs porting.
- **Fixes in your own fork.** Fork the project, fix what you find and send the change back. Keep game files, keys and
  anything generated from your game out of it.

## Credits

Hookshot exists thanks to the work of many people:

- **NotRexed**: Hookshot, BlueShell (Mario Kart World), Skybound (Tears of the Kingdom) and the a64-kit tools.
- **[Eden](https://git.eden-emu.dev/eden-emu/eden)** and **Eglantine**: the shader recompiler and Switch 2 shader work.
- **suyu**: the graphics decoders and the AArch64 translator.
- **[seedds/nxnative](https://github.com/seedds/nxnative)**: reference for how task and mesh shaders work.
- **[zortos293/Lichii](https://github.com/zortos293/Lichii)**: reference for Ampere shader lowering.
- **[kinnay/zbic](https://github.com/kinnay/zbic)**, **Opus** and **SDL**: decompression, audio and controllers.

It also includes code from Eden and suyu, which stays under the GPL, so a compiled game as a whole is covered by
